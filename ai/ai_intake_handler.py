TASK:
- Produce a concise plan of next steps for this repository.
- Focus on high-leverage automation work (not just docs).
- Output a short intro, then a numbered list of concrete tasks.
- For each task, mention which files/folders are likely involved.
- Keep it short enough to fit comfortably in a single GitHub comment.
